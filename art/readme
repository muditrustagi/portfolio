Contains art (2D/3D) of my custom art for the portfolio 

# Education section 
Indiana jones walking down a rope with a torch in hand. 
egyptic room textured, framed education details on the background wall.
Mouse movement moves the torch, and sees the education frame. 
Scroll movement allows the descent of character from the rope. 
Why do we need 3d art and not 2d art? 
Art should be pixelated in format to give a more computeristic feel.
